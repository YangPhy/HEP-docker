## Why is `MadGraph5_aMC-NLO` called `MadGraph`?
In the 1990s, while studying at the [University of Wisconsin-Madison](https://www.wisc.edu/), Bill Long developed a computer program for generating Feynman diagrams. The creator of [`HELAS`](https://lib-extopc.kek.jp/preprints/PDF/1991/9124/9124011.pdf) came across this program and proposed integrating it with [`HELAS`](https://lib-extopc.kek.jp/preprints/PDF/1991/9124/9124011.pdf) by substituting the diagrams with the corresponding wave functions or vertices from [`HELAS`](https://lib-extopc.kek.jp/preprints/PDF/1991/9124/9124011.pdf). This collaboration resulted in the development of Mad(ison)Graph. (Source: [Tao Han](https://www.physicsandastronomy.pitt.edu/people/tao-han))
